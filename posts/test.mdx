## How many roads must a man walk down?

```javascript
const random = Math.floor(Math.random()*1000) + 1
console.log(`${random} roads.`)
```

and

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"gonum.org/v1/gonum/blas/blas64"
	"gonum.org/v1/gonum/lapack/lapack64"
	"gonum.org/v1/gonum/mat"
	blasnetlib "gonum.org/v1/netlib/blas/netlib"
	lapacknetlib "gonum.org/v1/netlib/lapack/netlib"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func init() {
	blas64.Use(blasnetlib.Implementation{})
	lapack64.Use(lapacknetlib.Implementation{})
}

func main() {
	t1 := time.Now()
	data := make([]float64, 2000*2000)
	for i := range data {
		data[i] = rand.Float64()
	}
	t2 := time.Now()
	a := mat.NewDense(2000, 2000, data)
	t3 := time.Now()
	a.Mul(a.T(), a)
	t4 := time.Now()
	var eigen mat.Eigen
	eigen.Factorize(a, mat.EigenNone)

	t5 := time.Now()
	svd := new(mat.SVD)

	svd.Factorize(a, mat.SVDNone)
	t6 := time.Now()

	fmt.Println("Total time taken:", time.Since(t1))
	fmt.Println("Time taken to generate data:", t2.Sub(t1))
	fmt.Println("Time taken to create matrix:", t3.Sub(t2))
	fmt.Println("Time taken to multiply matrix:", t4.Sub(t3))
	fmt.Println("Time taken to calculate eigenvalues:", t5.Sub(t4))
	fmt.Println("Time taken to calculate svd:", t6.Sub(t5))
}

### Latency is slow. 

To make up for lost time, you can enjoy blockquotes:

> "We are not accustomed to measuring our everyday encounters in milliseconds, but studies have shown that most of us will reliably report perceptible “lag” once a delay of over 100–200 milliseconds is introduced into the system. Once the 300 millisecond delay threshold is exceeded, the interaction is often reported as “sluggish,” and at the 1,000 milliseconds (1 second) barrier, many users have already performed a mental context switch while waiting for the response—anything from a daydream to thinking about the next urgent task.

##### Mermaid charts are fun

A deterministic set of instructions, 

> Do A, then B, then C, then D, then E.

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'normal', "flowchart" : { "curve" : "basis" } } }%%
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    B-->C;
```

We could change this, and instead, you could tell an omnipotent deity:
> Salam, deus, you have a set of "actions" you can take. You must use *initially* use your abilities in a specific order A --> B --> C, however, after that point, you are free to choose whichever action you like.


```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'normal', "flowchart" : { "curve" : "basis" } } }%%
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    B-->C;
    C-->D;
    D-->E;
    D-->F;
    D-->G;
    E-->D;
    F-->D;
    G-->D;
```


##### More reasons why mermaid is nice: 

Enter, the subgraph:


```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'normal', "flowchart" : { "curve" : "basis" } } }%%
graph TD;
    PROMPT-->SQL-EXECUTOR
    EVIDENCE-AGGREGATOR-->ACTION
    subgraph one [ORIGINAL]
    EMBED-->RETRIEVE;
    RETRIEVE-->FILTER;
    FILTER-->RERANK;
    RERANK-->ACTION;
    ACTION-->DOCS;
    ACTION-->USER;
    ACTION-->HISTORY;
    DOCS-->ACTION;
    USER-->ACTION;
    HISTORY-->ACTION;
    ACTION-->PROMPT;
    end
    subgraph two [FAILURE LOOP]
    SQL-EXECUTOR-->SUCCESS;
    SQL-EXECUTOR-->FAILURE;
    FAILURE-->EVIDENCE-AGGREGATOR
    end
```

##### An even more involved Mermaid diagram 

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'forest', 'fontSize': 48, 'barHeight': 36, 'taskTextRight': 'always', 'titleTopMargin': 50,  "flowchart" : { "curve" : "basis" }} }%%
gantt
    dateFormat  s 
    axisFormat  %S.%Ls
    title       Latency Comparison
    excludes    weekends
    %% (`excludes` accepts specific dates in YYYY-MM-DD format, days of the week ("sunday") or "weekends", but not the word "weekdays".)
